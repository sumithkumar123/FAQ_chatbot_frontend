The platform is built in such a way that activities and classrooms can be scheduled in advance. Students login with login credentials provided to them by system administrator as per schedule of course the student is enrolled into. Students can be enrolled in multiple courses simultaneously. Students will be able to view activities in their dashboard. They need to install Adobe Connect to attend the virtual class in this platform.\\n\\nIn Adobe connect has following features:\\n\\nAudio\\n\\nVideo\\n\\nRecording\\n\\nChat\\n\\nPolls\\n\\nAttendance\\n\\nShare screen\\n\\nTessellator\\nTessellator is KMIT’s learning management system. It is a customized version of MOODLE, an open source learning management system provided by Google. We, at KMIT, have customized it as per our needs and have been using it on multiple networks. It provides an option of two different modules. After each programming class, students are required to take a quiz which is a collection of multiple choice questions. Once they submit the quiz, they are presented with a form where they have guidelines to write code( program Eg: JAVA, C) pertaining to the class held. There are usually three programs given to the students as a part of the test. If the student is a slow learner, he/ she might be able to work on a single program. The fast learners may go to the 3rd program. Google’s platform MOODLE by itself doesn’t have the code compilation technique but we at KMIT have extended its capabilities to suffice our needs and have added code compilation techniques for JAVA, C and few other programming languages.\\n\\nOther Research projects -\\nAY-2023-2024\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tType\\tFunding Agency\\tAmount\\tDuration\\n1\\tA Mutli-GPU Implementation of Cerans Solver\\tSponsored Research\\tDefence Research and Development Laboratory\\t₹ 1999000\\t2 years (ongoing)\\n2\\tSoftware tool to perform Detailed Subsystems Level Checks and to report information about Aerospace vehicle health\\tSponsored Research\\tDRDO - Hyd\\t₹ 9.75 Lacs\\tOngoing\\n3\\tComputer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20)\\tSponsored Research\\tBIRAC\\t₹ 15 Lacs\\tOngoing\\n\\nAY-2022-2023\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tType\\tFunding Agency\\tAmount\\tDuration\\n1\\tA Mutli-GPU Implementation of Cerans Solver\\tSponsored Research\\tDefence Research and Development Laboratory\\t₹ 19,99,000\\t2 years (ongoing)\\n2\\tComputer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20)\\tSponsored Research\\tBIRAC\\t₹15L\\tOngoing\\n\\nAY-2021-2022\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tFunding Agency\\tType\\tAmount\\tDuration\\n1\\tObject Detection and Tracking (ODT) in Infrared Images with Application to Guidance and Control\\tSponsored Research\\tADVAITA CARS\\t985000\\t6 months\\n2\\tComputer Aided Diagnostic system for cancer (BIRAC/IKP01207/BIG-16/20)\\tSponsored Research\\tBIRAC\\t₹15L\\tOngoing\\n3\\tFace detection door lock system using raspberry pi\\tResearch\\tSelf Funded\\tNA\\tOngoing\\n4\\tAutomated face mask detection & temperature alert system\\tResearch\\tSelf Funded\\tNA\\tOngoing\\n5\\tDrone for Defense Application\\tResearch\\tSelf Funded\\tNA\\tOngoing\\n\\nAY-2020-2021\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tFunding Agency\\tType\\tYear\\tAmount\\n1\\tCAD4MBC with customization\\tYashoda Hospitals/Indo American\\tResearch\\tOngoing\\t₹15L\\n2\\tDefining new crypto protocols for signal processing\\nto be used in SDR applications for missile Design\\tDRDL\\tResearch\\t2020\\tSelf Funded\\n\\nAY-2019-2020\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tFunding Agency\\tType\\tYear\\tAmount\\n1\\tSpider Robot\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\tOngoing\\tSelf Funded\\n2\\tWalking robot\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\tOngoing\\tSelf Funded\\n3\\tCADC\\tBIRAC\\tSponsored Project\\t2019\\t₹50L\\n4\\tVirtual Police Station\\tSIH\\tInnovation/EDC\\t2019\\tNA\\n5\\tKisaan portal\\tKisan Forum Pvt Limited - SIH\\tInnovation / EDC\\t2019\\t₹1L\\n6\\tSpider Robo\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\t2019\\tSelf Funded\\n7\\tDoshi Anveshan Yantra\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\t2019\\tSelf Funded\\n\\nAY-2018-2019\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tFunding Agency\\tType\\tYear\\tAmount\\n1\\tAbhimanyu Humanoid\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\t2018\\tSelf Funded\\n2\\tSmart And Friendly Irrigation System Using IOT\\tTeleparadigm\\tResearch\\t2018\\t₹30,000\\n3\\tControl Systems Lab\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\t2018\\tSelf Funded\\nAY-2016-2017\\nS.No\\tProject Title\\tFunding Agency\\tType\\tYear\\tAmount\\n1\\tEDC Lab\\tKMIT\\tResearch\\t2016\\tSelf Funded\\n\\nConsultancy Projects -\\nCrime Free Bharat-An MP Police Initiative\\nCrime Free Bharat Mission is dedicated to creating holistic and comprehensive solutions for creating crime free Bharat.

In addition, plagiarism undercuts the basic purposes of higher education by short-circuiting the processes of inquiry, reflection and communication that lead to learning.\\n\\nPlagiarism can take several forms, including but not limited to:\\nUsing the exact words of another writer in part of a paper without both citation and quotation marks (or block indentation in the case of longer quotations)\\n\\nCutting and pasting material from Internet or other electronic resources without proper citation of sources\\n\\nIncluding the paraphrased or summarized idea of another writer without acknowledging its source\\n\\nAccepting excessive assistance from another person in writing a paper without informing readers of the nature and extent of that collaboration\\n\\nSubmitting for credit a complete paper or portion of a paper written by another person, no matter whether the paper was purchased, shared freely, stolen, found or acquired by other means\\n\\nSubmitting music, drawings, paintings, sculptures or photographs that copy or rely closely on the work of other artists, without explicitly citing the original source\\n\\nWriting a computer program that is the same or closely similar to existing sources\\n\\ncredit for a project, multimedia presentation, poster or other assignment that draws dishonestly on the work of others\\n\\nDuplicate submission is also a violation of academic integrity, because every assignment presumes that new inquiry and effort will produce new learning, and submitting a paper already written for another occasion subverts this learning. Submitting the same original paper for credit in more than one class in the same semester, without the expressed permission of both instructors involved, is not acceptable. Using the same paper or closely similar material from one semester to fulfill a requirement in another semester is normally not allowed without specific permission from the instructor. If students receive the same or similar assignments in different courses, they should consult with the professor about alternate assignments.\\n\\nRecognizing that students may sometimes commit plagiarism unintentionally because they do not know the conventions of quotation, citation and acknowledgement, professors may deal with cases of plagiarism in different ways. When in the professor’s judgment the student intends to do honest work but doesn\\'t yet understand the conventions of academic quotation and acknowledgment, the professor may require the student to rewrite the paper, may lower the grade on the paper or may fail the paper.\\n\\nCases of plagiarism that result in a failing grade for an assignment or for a course must be reported to the Provost in order to prevent any individual from plagiarizing repeatedly and each time professing ignorance. If a student plagiarizes repeatedly, the Provost may apply additional penalties, including dismissal from the college.\\n\\nResearch Workshops -\\nDigital Pathology for Breast Cancer-\\nThe R&D Centre at Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology in conjunction with Tapadia Diagnostic Centre Pvt.

Hence, the initiative of creating the KMIT dance club was taken. We believe in bringing talented students across all years under one roof, on one platform.

We have created the Tessellator (Test and collate) which has radically and dramatically enriched our Teaching learning process. Other extremely useful products we have built are “Sanjaya” app and the “Netra” app for parent and student awareness and participation. Several more products are being planned to assist and enable teaching and learning process.\\n\\nOne of the tools being planned is for customized education for every student. We wish to use technology to ensure that we move away from “one size fits all” philosophy of education and ensure that we created a learning environment where in every student will learn based on the students individual capabilities.\\n\\nHR Policy\\nAny professional institution, aspiring for growth and development in the field of education, should have a clear vision of its policies and procedures for the furtherance and fruition of its activities. Not with standing good infrastructure in terms of buildings, laboratories, staff and other amenities, over-all academic achievement will be painfully low if the procedures, duties, responsibilities and target of every member of the teaching faculty and other employees are not clearly defined and strictly adhered to.\\n\\nIndividuals can put in their best efforts and direct their energies to the total fulfillment of their tasks, only if their duties and responsibilities are clearly known to them. Efficient functioning, achieving the targets, building individual profiles, avoidance of confusion and creation of good rapport with colleagues are possible only if the individuals are fully aware of the procedures and policies.\\n\\n'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Regulations\\nThe departments of the KMIT are responsible for the academic activities which include Teaching, Research and Industrial Consultancy.

It is our belief that this program will go a long way in bridging the industry-academia. The Finishing School is run concurrently with the B.Tech course, unlike other Finishing schools which are offered after the completion of B.Tech.\\n\\nModality:\\nThe Finishing School program consists of two semesters. The first semester of the Finishing School runs concurrently with the third year second semester of JNTUH while the second semester runs concurrently with the fourth year, first semester. A student has the choice to opt for various tracks offered.\\n\\nSyllabus:\\nFoundation Track: C, C++, Core and Advanced Java, RDBMS, OS fundamentals.\\n\\nAptitude Skills: Quantitative Techniques, Verbal Ability, Reasoning, Puzzles, General Knowledge, Group Discussion: General Interest, Creative topics, Education, Social Topics etc., ELearning: Video Sessions are available online, enabling concept revision.\\n\\nSoft Skills: Resume Writing, Interview Preparation, Business Dressing, Personality Development, Time Management, and others (per industry requirement)\\n\\nCustomized Workforce Development:\\nNormally Companies visit the Campus in the fourth year, first semester and select candidates. These Companies provide us with a desired skill set of technologies to be imparted to the selected students. The desired skill set is imparted through our specialized programme called Customized Workforce Development Program (CWD). Some of these programmes conducted are given below:\\n\\nVirtusa: RPA (Robotic, Process Automation), Data Science, AEM, Adobe Analytics\\n\\nZensar: Oracle Apps, Software Testing\\n\\nPersistent Systems: Salesforce\\n\\nTessellator:\\nKMIT uses an in-house LMS, Tessellator, to:\\n\\nmonitor and track attendance\\n\\nconduct classes\\n\\ngive and evaluate assignments\\n\\nhave Students compile and execute programmes\\n\\nconduct and evaluate tests\\n\\nassess student performance\\n\\n*KMIT does not charge students anything for campus placement training\\n\\nOutcomes of Finishing School program, an initiative at Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology (KMIT):\\nComprehensive Skill Development:\\nStudents would gain a strong foundation in programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, essential for various tech roles. They would also acquire practical experience in cutting-edge technologies such as GenAI, IoT, Cyber Security, and AWS, broadening their skill set and making them more versatile in the job market.\\n\\nHands-on Experience:\\nThrough carefully crafted programs and projects, students would get hands-on experience, enhancing their problem-solving skills and deepening their understanding of programming concepts and emerging technologies. This practical knowledge is invaluable in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nPreparation for In-Demand Careers:\\nBy focusing on in-demand technologies and providing real-world projects, the program prepares students for careers in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and IoT. This aligns them with current industry needs and trends, increasing their employability.\\n\\nMentorship and Guidance:\\nThe opportunity for mentorship and guidance from experienced instructors and mentors ensures that students receive personalized support tailored to their needs. This mentorship can provide insights, advice, and networking opportunities crucial for career advancement.\\n\\nAccess to Quality Education:\\nThe program's commitment to being completely free of charge ensures that deserving students, regardless of their financial background, have access to quality education and opportunities for professional growth. This commitment to inclusivity helps level the playing field and promotes diversity in the tech industry.\\n\\nEmpowerment and Career Advancement:\\nUltimately, the program aims to empower students to achieve their career aspirations and secure their dream jobs in the tech industry. By providing a transformative educational experience, it equips students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to succeed in their chosen careers and contribute meaningfully to the tech sector's growth and innovation.\\n\\n \\nFinishing School Faculty-\\nFinishing School Faculty Profiles\\nNeil Gogte (Programme Director & Lead Faculty )\\nNeil Gogte, the founder of KMIT, also conceptualized the Finishing School model.
